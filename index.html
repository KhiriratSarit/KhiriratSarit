     [February, 2019] Our paper titled <i><b>"Convergence bounds 
         for compressed gradient methods 
         with memory based error compensation"</b></i>
     has been accepted in  <i>IEEE ICASSP 2019.</i>

        Abstract: <i> The veritable scale of modern data necessitates 
            information compression in parallel/distributed big-data optimization.
             Compression schemes using memory-based error compensation have displayed 
             superior performance in practice, however, to date there are no 
             theoretical explanations for these observed advantages.  
             This paper provides the first theoretical support for why such 
             compression schemes yields higher accuracy solutions in optimization. 
             Our results cover both gradient and incremental gradient algorithms 
             for quadratic optimization. Unlike previous works, our theoretical results 
             explicitly quantify the accuracy gains from error compensation, especially 
             for ill-conditioned problems. Finally, the numerical results on linear 
             least-squares problems validate the benefit of error compensation and 
             demonstrate tightness of our convergence guarantees.</i>
